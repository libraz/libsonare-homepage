/**
 * Block-by-block streaming variant of {@link masteringChain}.
 *
 * Maintains processor state across {@link processMono}/{@link processStereo}
 * calls. Only ProcessorBase-backed stages are supported: `eq.tilt`,
 * `dynamics.deesser`, `dynamics.transientShaper`, `dynamics.compressor`,
 * `dynamics.multibandComp`, `saturation.tape`, `saturation.exciter`,
 * `spectral.airBand`, `stereo.imager` (stereo only), `stereo.monoMaker`
 * (stereo only), `maximizer.truePeakLimiter`. Configurations that enable ANY of
 * the five whole-signal repair stages (`repair.declick`, `repair.declip`,
 * `repair.decrackle`, `repair.dehum`, `repair.dereverb`) throw at construction.
 *
 * `repair.denoise` runs here, but only with a noise estimator that is recursive
 * in time. Its default ranks every frame of the whole signal by energy, which a
 * stream never reaches the end of, so it is refused by name rather than
 * substituted; set `repair.denoise.noiseEstimator` to `1` (MCRA), `2` (IMCRA)
 * or `3` (speech-presence probability). The two minimum-tracking estimators
 * (`1` and `2`) seed their noise floor from the first frame they see and hold it
 * for the half second their minimum window spans, so a stream opened in the
 * middle of the programme is over-suppressed until it turns over; `3` tracks no
 * minimum and is unaffected. Prefer `3` past that opening too: `1` and `2`
 * over-report the floor for as long as the programme stays intermittent, and on
 * a gated tone they leave the result below the untreated input.
 *
 * An enabled `loudness` stage also throws unless
 * {@link StreamingMasteringChainConfig.loudnessStaticGainDb} supplies a
 * precomputed normalization gain.
 *
 * Call {@link delete} (or use a `try/finally`) to release the underlying WASM
 * object — the embind handle is not garbage-collected automatically.
 *
 * Reachable from the AudioWorklet realm through the `sonare/worklet` entry, but
 * the realtime contract is the caller's to keep:
 *
 * - {@link prepare} builds the processors and allocates. Call it once from a
 *   message handler, never from `AudioWorkletProcessor.process()`.
 * - {@link processMono}/{@link processStereo} return fresh arrays. On the render
 *   thread, reuse the returned reference for the block rather than retaining it.
 * - An enabled `loudness` stage needs `loudnessStaticGainDb` measured offline,
 *   because whole-signal integrated LUFS cannot be measured block by block. Pass
 *   `loudnessStaticGainPeakDb` too and the static gain is clamped exactly as the
 *   offline chain clamps it, so the live preview matches the render.
 * - {@link flush} output starts {@link latencySamples} samples early; discard
 *   that many leading samples when time alignment matters.
 *
 * The chain is a host-side stage, not an engine insert: it does not participate
 * in the engine's PDC or bypass, so latency compensation against other engine
 * outputs is also the caller's.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const chain = new StreamingMasteringChain({ eq: { tiltDb: 1.0 } });
 * try {
 *   chain.prepare(44100, 512, 1);
 *   const out = chain.processMono(blockSamples);
 * } finally {
 *   chain.delete();
 * }
 * ```
