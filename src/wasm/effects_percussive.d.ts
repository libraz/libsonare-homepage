/**
 * Extract editable percussive events from audio alone.
 *
 * Each event is a struck sound located in time: a span in source samples, its
 * detector strength, the percussive peak over the span, the share of the span's
 * energy the separation called percussive, and an identity
 * {@link PercussiveEventEdit}. Edit the events and hand them to
 * {@link renderPercussiveEvents} to apply the result — the source audio is never
 * mutated, and a set whose edits are all identity renders back to the input bit
 * for bit.
 *
 * Onsets are detected on the percussive component rather than on the source, so
 * a harmonic attack is attenuated before the detector sees it instead of being
 * filtered out afterwards. Each onset opens a span that the next one closes,
 * capped by `maxEventMs` and never running past the end of the audio.
 *
 * Each onset is backtracked to the transient's start, which is not optional and
 * is why there is no knob for it: peak-picking lands after the attack, and a span
 * that opened there would report the next hit's peak and leave its own attack
 * behind when muted.
 *
 * An event carries no pitch and is never associated with a {@link NoteObject} —
 * a struck sound has no steady F0 to edit, so the two models are extracted by
 * separate calls.
 *
 * @param request - Audio, its sample rate, and the separation, peak-picking and
 *   span options
 * @returns One {@link PercussiveEvent} per detected hit, in time order; an empty
 *   array when nothing was detected
 * @throws RangeError when the samples or sample rate fail the shared input checks
 * @throws SonareError (`InvalidParameter`) on a kernel size that is not an
 *   integer within the 32-bit range, a framing size that is negative or outside
 *   that range, a framing that breaks constant overlap-add, an `onsetWait` that
 *   is fractional, negative or non-finite, a negative or non-finite `onsetDelta`
 *   / `maxEventMs`, or a `minPercussiveRatio` outside `[0, 1]`
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const events = extractPercussiveEvents({ samples, sampleRate });
 * // Drop the second hit and push the third 10 ms late.
 * events[1].edit.muted = true;
 * events[2].edit.timeOffsetSamples = Math.round(0.01 * sampleRate);
 * const edited = renderPercussiveEvents({ samples, sampleRate, events });

/**
 * Render edited percussive events back over their source audio.
 *
 * Per event the lifted signal is the percussive component over
 * `[onsetSample, offsetSample)` under the tail fade. It is subtracted where it
 * sits and, unless the event is muted, added back at the shifted position scaled
 * by the gain. Only that signal moves, so muting a hit leaves the harmonic
 * content under it sounding and moving one does not drag its neighbours' sustain
 * along.
 *
 * Each event's span and `edit` are read; `strength`, `peakAmplitude` and
 * `percussiveRatio` are ignored, so an extracted event can be passed back as-is,
 * or an event can be built by hand from the span alone. A set whose edits are all
 * identity reproduces the input bit for bit and runs no separation at all.
 *
 * Pass the separation the events were extracted with: a different one lifts a
 * different signal out of the span than the one the events describe. It is
 * validated even when every edit is the identity and no separation runs, so an
 * unusable framing is an error on every set rather than on some of them.
 *
 * Overlap is checked on the source spans only. Where `timeOffsetSamples` lands an
 * event is not, so two moved events may be written over each other, and a shift
 * that pushes the signal past either end is truncated there rather than wrapped.
 *
 * @param request - Source audio, the events to render, the separation and the
 *   tail fade
 * @returns The rendered audio, the same length and sample rate as the input
 * @throws RangeError when the samples or sample rate fail the shared input checks
 * @throws SonareError (`InvalidParameter`) on an event whose span is empty,
 *   reversed or outside the audio, overlapping source spans, a non-finite
 *   `gainDb`, a kernel size that is not an integer within the 32-bit range, a
 *   framing that breaks constant overlap-add, or a negative or non-finite
 *   `fadeMs`

 * ```ts
 * const events = extractPercussiveEvents({ samples, sampleRate });

 * // Lift the loudest hit by 3 dB and leave the rest untouched.
