 * The facade's single FFT-size/hop domain.
 *
 * This module is deliberately internal: sibling facade modules import it, but
 * nothing re-exports it, so it stays out of the package entry point and out of
 * the C-ABI parity surface (which is defined by the index's re-export closure).

/**
 * Resolves and validates the `nFft` / `hopLength` pair every STFT-backed entry
 * point takes.
 *
 * The core FFT is mixed-radix, so any even size transforms exactly; only the
 * real one-sided spectrum's `n_fft / 2 + 1` bin layout needs the evenness. A
 * power-of-two restriction rejects sizes the C ABI and the native CLI accept,
 * which is what a second copy of this rule used to do: `hpss({ nFft: 1536 })`
 * worked while `hpssWithResidual({ nFft: 1536 })` threw, with the message
 * asserting a constraint this project had explicitly written down as untrue.
 * One implementation, so the two cannot disagree again.
