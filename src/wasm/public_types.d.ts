 * One parameter descriptor in the cross-surface capability catalog.

 * `default` is the value the processor uses when the key is absent, read from

 * with no construction key.
 *
 * `min` and `max` are the range construction ACCEPTS, measured by handing
 * candidate values to the same code path a caller would use. They are a hard
 * constraint, not a recommended UI range — a value outside them is an error,
 * while an unvalidated control (most gains) reports null on both, meaning
 * "this catalog states no limit" rather than "unknown". Three properties to
 * plan for: a bound is measured with every other parameter at its default, so
 * two parameters that constrain each other each report the other's default; a
 * sample-rate-derived bound reflects the un-prepared processor and rises once
 * the insert is prepared at a higher rate; and an exclusive bound is reported
 * as its limit value, so a control requiring `> 0` reports `min` 0 and still
 * rejects 0.
