 * `rtSafe` false.
 *
 * `type` is `"enum"` when `choices` names every declared enumerator
 * construction accepts (sent as the number in its `choices` entry), or
 * `"string"` / `"array"` for a construction-only key (an embedded impulse
 * response, a per-band list) that reports null for `min`, `max`, `default`
 * and `choices`.
 *
 * `default` is the value the processor uses when the key is absent, read from
 * the config struct's own field initializer, an enum as its number; it is
 * null for a param id with no construction key, a `"string"` / `"array"` key,
 * or a construction key with no fallback.
 *
 * `min` and `max` are the range construction ACCEPTS, measured by handing
 * candidate values to the same code path a caller would use. They are a hard
 * constraint, not a recommended UI range — a value outside them is an error,
 * while an unvalidated control (most gains) reports null on both, meaning
 * "this catalog states no limit" rather than "unknown". Non-null only when
 * `choices` is null: `choices` non-null names the closed accepted set instead
 * (every declared enumerator, or a `"number"` key whose accepted integers
 * have holes), and then both bounds are null. Three properties to plan for: a
 * bound is measured with every other parameter at its default, so two
 * parameters that constrain each other each report the other's default; a
 * sample-rate-derived bound reflects the un-prepared processor and rises once
 * the insert is prepared at a higher rate; and an exclusive bound is reported
 * as its limit value, so a control requiring `> 0` reports `min` 0 and still
 * rejects 0.
