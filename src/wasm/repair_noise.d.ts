/**
 * Offline STFT-domain classical denoiser for a stereo pair, driven by one channel-linked
 * gain mask.
 *
 * The mask is built from the channel-summed power and applied unchanged to both channels, so
 * the pass cannot move an interchannel level or phase difference. That is also why the result
 * carries a single `report` rather than one per channel: a pair would be two copies of one
 * measurement and would read as though the two could differ.
 *
 * `report.detected` is therefore a *pair-level* measurement, and the only absolute one in the
 * result. Its levels are dBFS on the channel-summed power, so two identical channels read
 * `10*log10(2)` — about 3.01 dB — above the same material through
 * {@link masteringRepairDenoiseClassical}. A stereo floor is comparable only against another
 * stereo floor, never against a mono one.
 *
 * Needs at least `nFft` samples and REJECTS a shorter input, which is the opposite of
 * {@link masteringRepairDereverbClassicalStereo} — that one pads.
 *
 * Which options are live depends on `mode`: `overSubtraction` and `spectralFloor` are read
 * only by `spectralSubtraction`, and `speechPresenceGain` and `gainSmoothing` only by the
 * other two, so at the default `logMmse` the first pair does nothing.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const { left, right, report } = masteringRepairDenoiseClassicalStereo({
 *   left: leftSamples,
 *   right: rightSamples,
 *   sampleRate: 48000,
 *   reductionDb: 18,
 * });
 * console.log(report.detected.floorDbfs, report.meanReductionDb);

 * Bin boundaries of the grid {@link masteringRepairDetectNoiseFloor} reports `bandFloorDbfs` on.
 *
 * Band `k` covers the one-sided STFT bins `[bins[k], bins[k + 1])`, and bin `b` sits at
 * `b * sampleRate / nFft` Hz.
 *
 * The geometric band edges are rounded to bins, so a band narrower than the bin spacing comes
 * out EMPTY — `bins[k] === bins[k + 1]` — and its `bandFloorDbfs[k]` reads as the floor
 * sentinel because no bin landed in it, NOT because that region was quiet. Telling those two
 * apart is what this grid is for, and the rounding cannot be recovered from the band count
 * alone.
 *
 * Nothing but the analysis geometry decides the grid, so no denoise config is taken: one call
 * describes every floor measured at that `nFft` and `sampleRate`, whatever mode or estimator
 * produced it.
 *
 * @param nFft - STFT size the bins belong to; a positive power of two, the same rule
 *   {@link masteringRepairDetectNoiseFloor} applies to its config, so every grid returned here
 *   is one that entry can report on. Defaults to 1024.
 * @param sampleRate - Sample rate the bins belong to, in Hz; positive. Defaults to 22050.
 * @returns 33 bin indices, low to high — one more than the 32 bands: the first bin of every
 *   band plus the one-past-the-end bin of the last, which is `nFft / 2 + 1`. Non-decreasing.
 * @throws If `nFft` is not a positive power of two, or `sampleRate` is not positive.

 * ```ts
 * const bins = masteringRepairNoiseBandBins({ nFft: 1024, sampleRate: 48000 });
 * const floor = masteringRepairDetectNoiseFloor({ samples, sampleRate: 48000, nFft: 1024 });
 * floor.bandFloorDbfs.forEach((level, k) => {
 *   if (bins[k] === bins[k + 1]) return; // empty band: `level` is the sentinel, not a measurement
 *   console.log((bins[k] * 48000) / 1024, level);
