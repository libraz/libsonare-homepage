/**
 * Host-supplied PCM for the sample synthesis engine: a bank of float samples
 * plus key/velocity keymaps, bound alongside a {@link SynthPatch} whose
 * `engineMode` is `'sample'`.
 *
 * {@link Project.loadSoundFont} is the other door into sampled playback — it
 * parses a container and brings its own generator model. This one takes
 * waveforms a host already has, described by nothing but a keymap, so playing
 * them does not require authoring an SF2. Decoding is the caller's job, and
 * WASM has no host filesystem: the bank takes mono float frames from memory.
 *
 * A bank is built on the control thread and then read as immutable data. Add
 * every sample and zone BEFORE the bounce that binds it starts: the pool is
 * contiguous and moves as it grows, so a sample added while something sounds
 * invalidates the voices reading it.
 *
 * The embind handle is not garbage-collected, so release it with
 * {@link SampleBank.delete} once every bounce that names it has finished.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const bank = new SampleBank();
 * try {
 *   const index = bank.addSample(pcm, { rootKey: 60, sourceRate: 44100 });
 *   bank.addZone({ sampleIndex: index });  // the whole keyboard
 *   const audio = project.bounceWithSynthInstrument(
 *     { engineMode: 'sample', sampleSet: 0, sampleBank: bank },
 *     { totalFrames: 24000 },
 *   );
 * } finally {
 *   bank.delete();
 * }
 * ```
